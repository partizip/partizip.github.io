Good luck on your test!

##Test Mode
Test mode simulates the test you’ll receive in class. It’s the perfect way to check your knowledge before the real exam.

##Training Mode
Random words are displayed, and you have to provide the correct translations. This is the perfect way to learn vocabulary before the test.

We encourage you to practice!
